## Design Quality

### Layout
- The homepage follows a traditional top-down structure: navigation → hero banner → doctor profile → service highlights → footer.
- Content is organized in a logical pyramid — introduction first, then credentials, then detailed services.
- The layout is relatively clean but relies heavily on a single-column approach with minimal visual variation between sections.

### Colors
- Primary brand color is **#00809f** (teal/cyan), used consistently across buttons, links, and accent elements.
- White text on teal backgrounds provides adequate contrast.
- The overall palette is professional and appropriate for a medical/healthcare brand.

### Typography
- Font sizes are defined via CSS custom properties: 16px (small), 20px (medium), 24px (large), 42px (x-large).
- The type scale is functional but conservative — no strong typographic hierarchy to guide the eye.
- System/theme default fonts are used, which keeps loading fast but lacks brand personality.

### Spacing
- A responsive spacing system is in place using CSS variables.
- Whitespace is generally adequate, though some sections feel dense with text.

## Content Clarity

### Headline & Messaging
- **Hero headline:** "Providing medical care for the elderly" — clear and direct, communicates the core service immediately.
- **Sub-headline:** "Specialist clinic for geriatric medicine" — reinforces the specialty focus.
- The hero section also includes a definition of geriatric medicine from the British Geriatric Society, which adds authority.

### Call-to-Action
- Two primary CTAs in the hero: **"Our Clinic"** and **"Make an Enquiry"** — both are visible and clearly labeled.
- A secondary CTA ("Read more about our doctor") appears in the doctor profile section.
- CTA buttons use the brand teal color with white text, making them identifiable.

### Content Blocks
- Three informational blocks on the homepage cover expertise, patient differences, and the clinic mission.
- Messaging is medically accurate and informative, though somewhat text-heavy for a homepage.

## User Experience

### Desktop
- Navigation is well-structured with dropdown menus for About Us, Services, and Care topics.
- Skip-to-content and skip-to-footer links are present, supporting keyboard navigation.
- The page flows logically from value proposition to credentials to services.

### Mobile
- Responsive breakpoints are set at 800px, 767px, and 480px.
- A mobile menu toggle is implemented for navigation.
- The hero image is hidden on mobile (`display: none` below 767px), which simplifies the layout but loses visual impact.
- Line-height and spacing adjustments are made for smaller screens.

## Trust Factors

### Professional Credentials
- **A/Prof Sitoh Yih Yiow** is prominently featured with extensive qualifications: MBBS, MRCP, FRCP, MMed, LLM, and Academy of Medicine fellowship.
- Academic appointment as Adjunct Associate Professor at Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.
- Involvement in national clinical practice guideline committees (dementia, falls, osteoporosis).

### Hospital Affiliation
- The clinic is located at **Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital**, a well-known private hospital in Singapore — this is a strong trust signal.

### Branding & Credibility
- Professional branding with a consistent color palette and logo.
- Emergency contact number displayed in the header for immediate trust.
- Gmail-based email (agelinkclinic@gmail.com) slightly undermines the professional image.

### Missing Trust Elements
- No patient testimonials or reviews on the homepage.
- No patient statistics, success rates, or case studies.
- No third-party certifications or award badges visible.
